# üêæ Purrfect Match

Purrfect Match is a lightweight mobile app designed to connect pet owners through a community-driven playdate and resource board. Unlike adoption platforms such as Petfinder, our app focuses on building local connections between pet owners.

Playdates Tab: Dog-focused posts to find nearby play buddies.

Community Tab: A shared board for cats, rabbits, and small pets ‚Äî for tips, resources, and pet sitting arrangements.

Goal: Create a fun, mobile-first way for owners to discover events, share knowledge, and connect with others in their area.
