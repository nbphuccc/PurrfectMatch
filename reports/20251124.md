## Progress and Issues
This week, the team focused heavily on **frontend improvements**, fixing user-reported issues, and ensuring that all core and secondary features function consistently across devices. The majority of work centered around UI refinements, post interaction fixes, and improving the profile page.

- **Frontend:** Significant UI fixes were implemented, especially around keyboard overlap issues that were blocking text inputs across Community, Playdate, and Comments sections. Image selection was updated to allow users to select photos directly from their device rather than relying on URLs. General layout improvements and input validation adjustments were made to improve usability.  
- **Profile Features:** The profile page was expanded with support for profile pictures, and work has begun on adding a user bio section. Additional work was done to ensure usernames appear correctly on posts after login.  
- **Authentication:** Signup and login flows were finalized and are now fully functional, with smooth transitions between authentication and user pages.  
- **Bug Fixing:** The team resolved all bug/issue reports submitted by peer testers last week, significantly improving stability and user experience.  

**Key Issues**
- The new profile features require backend support for editable bio fields.  
- Some layout variations still occur between Android and iOS for deeply nested components.  
- Post filtering and deletion workflows need to be implemented before they can be tested.

## Individual Contributions

### Hsu (UI/UX Designer & Coordinator)
- **Progress:** Implemented the like button so likes are now stored and persisted in Firebase, resolved most peer-reported issues, and contributed to the presentation slides for the Gamma release.
- **Issues:** The app still needs more polish before it feels fully ready for production—some flows and UI pieces require additional refinement.
- **Next Week:** Even though the MVPs are finished, the plan is to go beyond the minimum and add features that will make the app more complete and user-friendly, including state-based search, avatars on playdate posts, editable profile pages, and the ability to delete posts.

### Xuan (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:**  The “like” feature is now fully implemented and successfully saving data to the backend, added functionality to display all posts created by the user within the profile tabs.
- **Issues:**  Clicking a post within the profile tab currently does not navigate to the post detail view.
- **Next Week:**  Continue working on the profile section to enable navigation from a post in the profile tab to its corresponding post page.

### Emily (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:**  Worked on connecting the comment and like for the playdate post to the backend to get stored. Also worked on fixing the UI issues within the playdate to make it more accessible. 
- **Issues:**  The profile icon isn't showing the user image yet. Will work with the backend team to finish implementing that function.
- **Next Week:**  Work on implementing the stretch goal of allowing users to delete playdate post. Will also try to implement function to automcatilly remove playdate posts for playdate that has passed. 3 days.

### Bao (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:**  Implement a "Profile" section for users, including name (real name), email status (public or private) and bio. Add an option for users to upload their avatar and make it available on posts and comments.
- **Issues:**  Profile still not yet editable.
- **Next Week:**  Make profile editable and posts deletable

### Larrianna (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Fixed multiple UI issues, including keyboard interactions that previously blocked text boxes in Community, Playdate, and Comments sections. Updated the image selection system to use the device’s photo library instead of relying on image URLs. 
- **Issues:** Some components still require UI adjustments for cross-platform consistency, and profile updates will need backend support for bio and editable fields.  
- **Next Week:** Support implementation of stretch goals by preparing backend logic for editable bios, enabling post deletion, and assisting with state-based post filtering (3 days).  

### Abi (Backend Support & Tester)
- **Progress:** Fixed UI community posts search button. Cleaned up codebase (remove old unused code and reorganized). Worked on testing new firebase codebase (unit testing for firebase methods and end to end). 
- **Issues:** Could not get the firebase emulator to run the tests. 
- **Next Week:** Continue with manual testing to find bugs and improve UI (3 days). Add frontend tests and tests to run with firebase test lab (or any tests that run the firebase methods) (3 days).
