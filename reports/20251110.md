# Team Report (Purrfect Match)

## Last Week’s Goals
- [x] Complete end-to-end wiring for Community & Playdate flows; standardize request/response schemas and error handling.  
- [x] Finalize JWT verification, refresh strategy, and protected route middleware.  
- [x] Produce and test beta build across iOS/Android devices.  
- [x] Expand Jest test coverage for backend features and ensure CI stability.  
- [x] Run structured beta testing and feedback review for feature completeness.

## Progress and Issues
This week, the team focused on **final polish and stability improvements** following the successful beta test. The app’s core MVP features, post creation and feeds for both tabs are fully functional. The focus has now shifted to fixing minor bugs, ensuring consistent UI across platforms, and verifying data synchronization between frontend and backend.

- **Backend:** All CRUD routes are implemented and stable. Minor performance tweaks were applied to reduce redundant API calls and improve database query speed.  
- **Frontend:** UI and navigation have been refined to provide smoother transitions between tabs and consistent rendering across iOS and Android. Form validation, alert messages, and error handling have been tested and refined based on beta feedback.  
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens now handle login and signup successfully. Work continues on refreshing tokens and improving error handling for expired sessions.  
- **Testing/CI:** Jest test coverage has improved, and CI runs are stable. Integration tests were expanded to include keyword search and community post validation.  

**Key Issues**
- Some API calls return delayed responses on slower devices due to fetch timeout thresholds.  
- JWT refresh handling still needs additional testing to confirm token expiry behavior.  
- Minor UI inconsistencies persist in Playdate form alignment and responsive scaling.

## Summary of Progress
- **Backend:** CRUD routes and database queries finalized.  
- **Frontend:** Full integration achieved; UI refinements and bug fixes ongoing.  
- **Authentication:** Stable login/signup with JWT; refresh logic being fine-tuned.  
- **Testing/CI:** Beta-tested; high coverage with minor integration tweaks ongoing.  
- **UI/UX:** Visuals and layouts nearly finalized; polishing for consistent user experience.

### Larrianna (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Continued to finalize backend–frontend integration for posts, comments, and keyword search. Conducted debugging sessions with frontend to resolve data mismatches and improve fetch reliability.
- **Issues:** Need to test keyword search results under large datasets to confirm accuracy and response times. Minor backend schema adjustments may be required to handle edge cases from frontend forms.  
- **Next Week:** Conduct final backend polish, refine search query performance, ensure all endpoints return consistent responses, and verify zero errors across MVP features (3 days).  

### Abi (Backend Support & Tester)
- **Progress:**  Wrote basic integration tests for backend of community posts. Wrote DAO tests for comments. Wrote front end and end to end integration tests for create playdate post. Found and fixed failure in saving created playdate post to the backend. 
- **Issues:** Figuring our create playdate post error took a lot of time. Incorrectly pulled and caused merge conflict. 
- **Next Week:** Integration tests for community (3 days). Integration tests for comments (3 days). Fix any failures found.
