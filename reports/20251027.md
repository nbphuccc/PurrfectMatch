### Xuan (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:** Implemented the front-end Sign Up page. Added input validation, loading states, and integrated the form with the backend API to handle account creation and display success or error messages to the user.
- **Issues:** Currently waiting for full backend integration to confirm that user data (email, username, password) is being stored correctly and to test error responses (when email or username already exists)
- **Next Week:** Begin working on the Sign In page and connect it with the backend authentication endpoint to allow users to log in after account creation.

### Bao (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Install JWT, learning about tokens
- **Issues:** Unsure how the frontend is sending back the tokens. accessToken should be in the header, but refreshToken should be in the body?
- **Next Week:** Decide whether tokens should be in the beta. Work on the interface with frontend in terms of tokens
