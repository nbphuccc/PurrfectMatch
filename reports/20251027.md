## Individual Contributions

### Hsu (UI/UX Designer & Coordinator)
- **Progress:** Set up GitHub Actions CI workflow and added it to the repo. Updated the Living Doc with the testing and CI plan. Refined the Create Account page in Figma to match current frontend structure.
- **Issues:** Waiting on the test codes in frontend and backend to check CI workflow works well.
- **Next Week:** Finalize Create Account + Sign in UI flow and help with user/developer guide documentation.

### Xuan (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:** Implemented the front-end Sign Up page. Added input validation, loading states, and integrated the form with the backend API to handle account creation and display success or error messages to the user.
- **Issues:** Currently waiting for full backend integration to confirm that user data (email, username, password) is being stored correctly and to test error responses (when email or username already exists)
- **Next Week:** Begin working on the Sign In page and connect it with the backend authentication endpoint to allow users to log in after account creation.

### Emily (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:** Implemented the front-end PlayDate tab and playdate form. Added input validation and integrated the form with the backend API to handle any errors in missing fields (dates, times, pet breed, city, and state). Also includes triggers to send the user a success message if their form was submitted successfully, or an error message if any required fields are missing.
- **Issues:** Having trouble figuring out how to validate mispelled or fake citites in the form. Also am currently waiting for full backend integrate to confirm how to verify if an user already created an account before having the ability to post. 
- **Next Week:** Begin working on connecting all the playdate validation with the backend to ensure all the data are stored correctly. 

### Bao (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Install JWT, learning about tokens
- **Issues:** Unsure how the frontend is sending back the tokens. accessToken should be in the header, but refreshToken should be in the body?
- **Next Week:** Decide whether tokens should be in the beta. Work on the interface with frontend in terms of tokens
