# Team Report (Purrfect Match)

## Last Week’s Goals
- [x] Implement and test CRUD routes for posts and comments (Playdates + Community APIs).  
- [x] Connect frontend tabs (Community + Playdate) to backend data and render posts dynamically.  
- [x] Develop signup/login routes using JWT and integrate with the profile screen.   
- [x] Refine Figma wireframes and align UI visuals with implemented components.  
- [x] Initialize Jest for backend testing and establish the CI pipeline.

## Progress and Issues
This week, the team made steady progress on backend development and began early stages of integration work. The backend CRUD routes for posts and comments were implemented, though integration with the frontend has not yet been completed. Bao began implementing JWT-based authentication but token verification and full signup/login flow are still in progress.  

On the frontend, Xuan and Emily continued refining the navigation flow and UI structure using Expo Router. They prepared components for API integration but have not yet connected to live backend endpoints. Keyword search for the Community tab has not been implemented yet.  

Abi successfully set up the Jest testing framework and created placeholder test files for backend routes. The CI setup is partially complete and will continue next week. Hsu made refinements to the Figma wireframes to align visuals with the components currently in development.  

The team collaborated effectively via Discord but faced challenges syncing frontend-backend data exchange and managing shared environment configurations for local testing.

## Summary of Progress
- **Backend Development:** CRUD routes for posts and comments implemented.  
- **Frontend:** Navigation structure and UI components prepared for integration.  
- **Authentication:** JWT setup started; routes partially implemented.  
- **Search Feature:** Not yet implemented.  
- **UI/UX:** Wireframes refined to reflect current app state.  
- **Testing:** Jest initialized; placeholder tests created; CI setup underway.

### Issues 
- Backend–frontend integration not yet completed.  
- JWT authentication incomplete.  
- Keyword search feature not implemented yet.  
- Environment variable and configuration syncing still needs refinement.

## Plans and Goals for Next Week
- **Backend (Larrianna & Bao):** Finalize endpoint naming and deploy backend to remote host for shared testing.  
  _Deadline: November 1, EOD_  
- **Frontend (Emily & Xuan):** Implement post creation validation and connect Community tab to backend APIs.  
  _Deadline: November 2, EOD_  
- **Authentication & Profiles (Bao):** Complete JWT token generation and verification, connect to profile routes.  
  _Deadline: November 2, EOD_  
- **UI/UX (Hsu):** Finalize high-fidelity prototype and begin preparing assets for presentation.  
  _Deadline: November 3, EOD_  
- **Testing (Abi):** Expand Jest test coverage to include authentication and CRUD operations.  
  _Deadline: November 3, EOD_

## Individual Contributions

### Hsu (UI/UX Designer & Coordinator)
- **Progress:** Set up GitHub Actions CI workflow and added it to the repo. Updated the Living Doc with the testing and CI plan. Refined the Create Account page in Figma to match current frontend structure.
- **Issues:** Waiting on the test codes in frontend and backend to check CI workflow works well.
- **Next Week:** Finalize Create Account + Sign in UI flow and help with user/developer guide documentation (3 days).

### Xuan (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:** Implemented the front-end Sign Up page. Added input validation, loading states, and integrated the form with the backend API to handle account creation and display success or error messages to the user.
- **Issues:** Currently waiting for full backend integration to confirm that user data (email, username, password) is being stored correctly and to test error responses (when email or username already exists)
- **Next Week:** Begin working on the Sign In page and connect it with the backend authentication endpoint to allow users to log in after account creation (3 days)

### Emily (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:** Implemented the front-end PlayDate tab and playdate form. Added input validation and integrated the form with the backend API to handle any errors in missing fields (dates, times, pet breed, city, and state). Also includes triggers to send the user a success message if their form was submitted successfully, or an error message if any required fields are missing.
- **Issues:** Having trouble figuring out how to validate mispelled or fake citites in the form. Also am currently waiting for full backend integrate to confirm how to verify if an user already created an account before having the ability to post. 
- **Next Week:** Begin working on connecting all the playdate validation with the backend to ensure all the data are stored correctly (3 days).

### Bao (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Install JWT, learning about tokens
- **Issues:** Unsure how the frontend is sending back the tokens. accessToken should be in the header, but refreshToken should be in the body?
- **Next Week:** Decide whether tokens should be in the beta. Work on the interface with frontend in terms of tokens (3 days).

### Larrianna (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Implemented CRUD routes for posts and comments; added test files and placeholder tests for future use.  
- **Issues:** Need to sync with frontend team to determine how to receive and process user input data through their code integration.  
- **Next Week:** Deploy backend server for remote integration testing (3 days).

### Abi (Backend Support & Tester)
- **Progress:**
- **Issues:**
