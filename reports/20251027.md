## Individual Contributions

### Hsu (UI/UX Designer & Coordinator)

### Xuan (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:** Implemented the front-end Sign Up page. Added input validation, loading states, and integrated the form with the backend API to handle account creation and display success or error messages to the user.
- **Issues:** Currently waiting for full backend integration to confirm that user data (email, username, password) is being stored correctly and to test error responses (when email or username already exists)
- **Next Week:** Begin working on the Sign In page and connect it with the backend authentication endpoint to allow users to log in after account creation.

### Emily (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:** Implemented the front-end PlayDate tab and playdate form. Added input validation and integrated the form with the backend API to handle any errors in missing fields (dates, times, pet breed, city, and state). Also includes triggers to send the user a success message if their form was submitted successfully, or an error message if any required fields are missing.
- **Issues:** Having trouble figuring out how to validate mispelled or fake citites in the form. Also am currently waiting for full backend integrate to confirm how to verify if an user already created an account before having the ability to post. 
- **Next Week:** Begin working on connecting all the playdate validation with the backend to ensure all the data are stored correctly. 

### Bao (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Install JWT, learning about tokens
- **Issues:** Unsure how the frontend is sending back the tokens. accessToken should be in the header, but refreshToken should be in the body?
- **Next Week:** Decide whether tokens should be in the beta. Work on the interface with frontend in terms of tokens
