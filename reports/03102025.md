# Team Report (Purrfect Match)

## Last Week’s Goals
- [x] Finalize endpoint naming, verify integration with frontend, and deploy backend for shared testing.  
- [x] Complete connection of Community and Playdate features to backend APIs and refine validation.  
- [x] Finalize JWT token handling and test login/logout functionality.  
- [x] Conduct visual QA and finalize high-fidelity mockups for the beta version.  
- [x] Expand Jest tests for authentication and commenting; finalize CI pipeline for automated runs.

## Progress and Issues
This week, the team focused heavily on **test suite quality** and **beta readiness**. We expanded Jest coverage, stabilized flaky tests, and improved our CI pipeline to catch regressions earlier.

- **Backend:** CRUD routes for posts/comments are implemented. We refined route contracts and added placeholder tests, but full **frontend integration is still pending** until data contracts are finalized.  
- **Authentication:** **JWT flow remains in progress**; token generation is prototyped, but verification + session handling need completion and alignment with frontend headers/body expectations.  
- **Frontend:** Components are prepared for API wiring; navigation and validation were refined, but **live API integration is not completed** yet.  
- **Testing/CI:** Significant time was invested here—unit test structure was standardized, and CI runs now surface clearer failure output. Some tests remain skipped pending integration decisions.

**Key Issues**
- Frontend–backend **data contract alignment** (payload shapes, status codes, error formats).  
- **Token handling** agreement (where access/refresh tokens live and how they’re transmitted).  
- A few **flaky tests** related to async DB setup/teardown and environment configuration.

## Summary of Progress
- **Backend:** CRUD routes in place; contracts refined; placeholder tests added.  
- **Frontend:** UI ready for wiring; validation patterns improved.  
- **Auth:** JWT prototype partial; verification and refresh flow pending.  
- **UI/UX:** Beta visuals tightened in Figma.  
- **Testing/CI:** Coverage expanded; CI stability improved; some tests still skipped pending integration.

## Plans and Goals for Next Week
- **Integration (FE+BE):** Complete end-to-end wiring for Community & Playdate flows; standardize request/response schemas and error handling.  
  _Deadline: Nov 13, EOD_
- **Authentication:** Finish JWT verification, refresh strategy, and protected route middleware; add happy-path and failure-path tests.  
  _Deadline: Nov 13, EOD_
- **Beta Candidate Prep:** Implement a short feature freeze mid-week; produce a signed beta build and smoke-test on iOS/Android emulators.  
  _Deadline: Nov 14, EOD_
- **Testing:** Raise backend route and auth coverage; unskip integration tests; stabilize DB lifecycle for tests.  
  _Deadline: Nov 14, EOD_
- **Observability & QA:** Add basic request logging and error tracing; run a structured bug bash and triage board.  
  _Deadline: Nov 15, EOD_

## Individual Contributions

### Hsu (UI/UX Designer & Coordinator)
- **Progress:** Last week, I completed documentation deliverables including the User Manual and Developer Guidelines. Also fixed the CI workflow failure in the GitHub repository and ensured all backend and frontend tests passed. Successfully connected the signup flow between backend and frontend, resolving API and schema mismatches.Also resolved React version compatibility issues to stabilize the development environment.
- **Issues:** Due to the heavy focus on testing and CI stabilization, Figma design alignment with the implemented UI was postponed.
- **Next Week:**  Update and align the implemented UI with the finalized Figma mockups. Focus on preparing beta presentation slides and visuals for the demo.
