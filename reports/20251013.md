# Team Report (Purrfect Match)

## Last Week’s Goals
- [ ] Meet as a team to finalize project scope and vision.  
- [ ] Discuss architecture and design ideas.  
- [ ] Start setting up GitHub repo and communication channels.  
- [ ] Assign general team roles (frontend, backend, UI/UX).  

## Progress and Issues
Last week, we clarified what exactly our project’s vision is. Before, we all had different ideas about what Purrfect Match was. After meeting 4–5 times, we decided to **pivot** from the original project pitch that focused on *pet adoption services* (with playdates as an extra feature) to instead focus on **community-based playdates and resource sharing** for pet owners.

We realized that pet adoption platforms already exist (like Petfinder), so our app’s unique value is enabling **local playdates** and **pet owner networking**.  

### Summary of progress
- **Concept:** Finalized the new focus (Playdates + Community tabs).  
- **Discussions:** Began outlining functional requirements and MVP scope.  
- **Design:** Rough wireframes and layout ideas shared on Figma.  
- **Setup:** GitHub repo and Discord channels created.  
- **Issues:**  
  - Architecture and design document not yet started.  
  - Unclear technical setup for backend (Express + DB).  
  - Still learning how to use Expo and connect frontend to backend.

## Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- [ ] Finish **Architecture & Design** document (due Oct 14).  
  - Include architecture diagram, data schema, API routes, and coding guidelines.  
- [ ] Define which tools and frameworks to use (Expo, Express, SQLite, JWT, Zod).  
- [ ] Finalize database schema for users, posts, and comments.  
- [ ] Start implementing basic frontend navigation using Expo (**Xuan + Emily**).  
- [ ] Set up Express backend skeleton and confirm it runs locally (**Bao + Larrianna + Abi**).  
- [ ] Prepare for next week’s sprint planning meeting.
