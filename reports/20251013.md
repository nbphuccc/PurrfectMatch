# Team Report (Purrfect Match)

## Last Week’s Goals
- [ ] Meet as a team to finalize project scope and vision.  
- [ ] Discuss architecture and design ideas.  
- [ ] Start setting up GitHub repo and communication channels.  
- [ ] Assign general team roles (frontend, backend, UI/UX).  

## Progress and Issues
Last week, we clarified what exactly our project’s vision is. Before, we all had different ideas on what a Purrfect Match was. After meeting with each other 4-5 times, we decided to change the original project pitch which focused on adoption services with playdates as an extra feature. After researching our competitors, we found that the adoption feature was already prevalent in other apps and websites. We struggled to figure out the novelty of our app in comparison to services like Facebook pet groups, Craigslist pets, and Reddit's r/Seattle. So, to differentiate ourselves from these services, we decided to focus on the playdate feature and add a community board for pet owners in the area. We talked extensively about the use cases of the app and we also formalized our MVPs and stretch goals. When it came to our MVPs and stretch goals, we had a difference of opinions on what should be stretch goals and what should be MVPs. What worked for us as a team to come to an agreement on our project's vision, was our weekly discord meetings. We learned several things in the past week. One thing we learned was how to work as a team through the group-challenge games we played in lecture. We learned that walking through and discussing use cases really benefits our team's mutual understanding of the project and its functionality. Currently, we are stuck on whether to separate or combine the community and playdate tabs.

### Summary of progress
- **Concept:** Finalized the new focus (Playdates + Community tabs).  
- **Discussions:** Began outlining functional requirements and MVP scope.  
- **Design:** Rough wireframes and layout ideas shared on Figma.  
- **Setup:** GitHub repo and Discord channels created.  
- **Issues:**  
  - Architecture and design document not yet started.  
  - Unclear technical setup for backend (Express + DB).  
  - Still learning how to use Expo and connect frontend to backend.

## Plans and Goals for the Next Week
- [ ] Finish **Architecture & Design** document (due Oct 14).  
  - Include architecture diagram, data schema, API routes, and coding guidelines.  
- [ ] Define which tools and frameworks to use (Expo, Express, SQLite, JWT, Zod).  
- [ ] Finalize database schema for users, posts, and comments.  
- [ ] Start implementing basic frontend navigation using Expo (**Xuan + Emily**).  
- [ ] Set up Express backend skeleton and confirm it runs locally (**Bao + Larrianna + Abi**).  
- [ ] Prepare for next week’s sprint planning meeting.
