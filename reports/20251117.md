## Progress and Issues
This week, the team focused on **finalizing the app and completing all MVP features**, while also beginning the high-priority transition to Firebase for cloud-based storage. The app is now nearing completion, with major features functional and most UI and performance issues resolved.

- **Backend:** The team continued improving route performance, cleaning up DAOs, and stabilizing middleware behavior. Firebase integration is nearly complete—most database reads and writes have been migrated or prepared for migration.  
- **Frontend:** Community and Playdate post creation flows have been refined to reduce errors and ensure consistency after backend fixes. UI components have been updated to match finalized Figma designs.  
- **Authentication:** JWT login/signup flow is stable. Work continues to ensure refresh and logout logic remains functional even after the move to Firebase.  
- **Testing/CI:** Additional integration tests were added for community posts, comments, and playdate features. CI stability has improved despite more complex testing scenarios.  
- **Firebase Migration (Priority 0):** The team is nearing completion of Firebase integration, enabling remote database storage for user data, posts, and comments. Initial read/write tests have passed, with only final schema alignment and validation checks remaining.  

**Key Issues**
- Some Firebase read/write operations need consistent error handling before full adoption.  
- Migration requires small schema adjustments to match frontend expectations.  
- Minor UI alignment issues persist after adopting new data formats.

## Summary of Progress
- **Backend:** DAO cleanup and middleware stabilization ongoing; Firebase integration nearly complete.  
- **Frontend:** Post creation and feed display are fully functional; UI refined for consistency.  
- **Authentication:** JWT flow stable; compatibility testing with Firebase underway.  
- **Testing/CI:** High coverage with additional integration tests; backend test reliability improved.  
- **Firebase Integration:** Most migration steps completed; final testing in progress.  
- **UI/UX:** Layout refinements nearly complete across both tabs and all form components.

## Plans and Goals for Next Week (Nov 17 - 24, 2025)
- **Firebase Completion (Priority 0):** Finalize schema alignment, error handling, and connection logic for all MVP features (Community, Playdates, Auth).  
  _Deadline: Nov 23, EOD_  
- **Backend Finalization (Larrianna & Bao):** Clean up any remaining DAO and middleware inconsistencies; ensure all routes work seamlessly with Firebase.  
  _Deadline: Nov 23, EOD_  
- **Frontend Polish (Emily & Xuan):** Ensure all frontend post flows properly read/write from Firebase; address UI responsiveness after migration.  
  _Deadline: Nov 23, EOD_  
- **Testing (Abi):** Update integration tests to use Firebase; ensure no regressions in post, comment, or login flows.  
  _Deadline: Nov 23, EOD_  
- **UI/UX (Hsu):** Perform final design QA and assist in preparing visuals for upcoming presentation/demonstration.  
  _Deadline: Nov 23, EOD_

## Individual Contributions

### Hsu (UI/UX Designer & Coordinator)
- **Progress:**  Finalized the updated Figma UI to align closely with the current app experience and completed two major Firebase migration pull requests. The community posts and comments were successfully migrated to Firebase, including full CRUD operations, Firestore integration on the community feed and detail screens, auto-refresh on screen focus, and creation of the necessary Firestore indexes. Playdates were also migrated to Firebase, with environment-based configuration, new Firestore functions for creating and listing playdates, and updates to PlayDate.tsx so posts are now saved to the cloud and visible to all users. This update also included improvements to guest posting behavior and the display of location and date/time.
- **Issues:**  Login and profile pages remain nonfunctional due to pending Firebase authentication setup and alignment with backend requirements.
- **Next Week:**  Work will focus on enabling like functionality for community posts using Firebase, as well as implementing Firebase-based likes and comments for playdate posts, followed by initial testing and UI refinement for both interaction flows.

### Xuan (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:**  Implemented the comment feature. When a user clicks on any post, they can now leave comments and read comments from others.
- **Issues:**  The "like" feature is currently not saving to the backend
- **Next Week:**  Collaborate with the backend team to ensure the "like" feature is properly saved. I may also look into the profile implementation, such as displaying all posts created by the user.

### Emily (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:**  Worked on implementing the user profile section after they created an account and logged in. Adding features to allow users to edit profile changes like optionally adding name, picture, bio, city, pet(s) name, pet(s) breed, pet(s) picture.
- **Issues:**  The features aren't fully functional yet as it doesn't store in the backend. 
- **Next Week:**  Will work on communicating with the backend team to figure out how to store the edits users made correctly so that the changes persist. 3 days

### Bao (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:**  Fixed client.ts and server.ts so that all devices can link between frontend and backend (web, android emulator and physical iphones). Adding auth.ts in api in frontend so that signup can connect to backend 
- **Issues:**  Login has not yet connected, and it is possible that physical android phones cannot connect frontend and backend
- **Next Week:**  Make signup functional, and then try to implement refresh and logout (will be challenging since they need tokens). Make an interface for what a user profile looks like.

### Larrianna (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Continued backend–frontend integration with a focus on the Firebase migration.
- **Issues:** Some database access logic still requires refinement to fully match Firebase’s non-relational schema. 
- **Next Week:** Finalize DAO refactoring for Firebase, ensure middleware consistency across all endpoints, and complete backend–frontend alignment for all MVP features (3 days).  

### Abi (Backend Support & Tester)
- **Progress:** Added unit and integration testing for community and playdates. Fixed community post saving on the backend. 
- **Issues:**  Migrating our database to firebase makes a lot of our code (+ tests) redundant. 
- **Next Week:**  Add new testing to playdates.ts and community.ts with our new firebase implementation (3 days). Help clean out old unused code (3 days).
