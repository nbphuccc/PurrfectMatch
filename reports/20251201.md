## Progress and Issues
This week marked the **final development cycle before release**, and the team focused on completing remaining features, stabilizing all workflows, and integrating last-minute improvements based on testing feedback.

- **Frontend:** Post deletion workflow and editable profile UI were partially completed. State-based filtering UI components were implemented and connected to mock data while backend work continues. Major UI consistency fixes were finalized for iOS and Android.  
- **Playdate Map Feature:** A new *mini-map* feature was added to Playdate posts, allowing users to preview the meetup location visually. This feature increases usability and clarity for scheduling meetups.  
- **Profile Page:** The profile picture feature is final, and the editable bio feature is nearly complete. Work continues on ensuring the profile updates sync correctly across sessions.  
- **Backend:** Routes for post deletion and editable bio fields were created. The team focused on ensuring data structure consistency across all new features, especially for filtering and profile updates.  
- **Testing/QA:** The team conducted final bug sweeps, targeting UI, location/map-related inconsistencies, and post/comment edge cases. Performance improvements were made to reduce lag during feed rendering.

**Key Issues**
- Minor synchronization delays when profile updates propagate across tabs.  
- State-based filtering requires more testing with real backend queries.  
- Mini-map rendering has slight variation between device types (pixel density differences).

- **Next Week:**  Research publishing options and assist with final UI polish and testing.

### Xuan (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:**  Added clickable posts and enabled auto-refresh on the profile tab.
- **Next Week:**  Test the app to make sure everything works correctly and fix any issues that come up.

### Emily (Frontend Developer)
- **Progress:**  Fixed the search UI for playdate where user can hit enter on keyboard for search instead of pressing the icon. Also added dropdown feature for time and date for extra validation to prevent user from selecting times that already passed. 
- **Issues:** Additional information like user contact and map location are not showing up on playdate posts. 
- **Next Week:**  Will work on fixing the issue of information not fully being displayed in playdate posts and test for edge cases before release (3 days). 

### Bao (Backend Developer)

- **Issues:**  
- **Next Week:**  

### Larrianna (Backend Developer)
- **Progress:** Added a new mini-map feature to Playdate posts, allowing users to see the meetup location on an embedded map. Completed fixes for UI issues related to location rendering, keyboard overlap, and layout stability across devices.
- **Issues:** Map rendering differs slightly across devices, requiring adjustments to styling. Additional backend support needed for complex state-based filtering.  
- **Next Week:** Finalize backend integration for all stretch-goal features, ensure all map/location data sync correctly, and verify zero errors before release (3 days).
